# Sprint 7 Project: Introduction to Test Automation
In this project, we automate the tests related to the kit creation feature. We validate the name field by implementing Python code: data and GET,POST methods.
Objectives:
- GitHub Usage.
- Test automation with PyTest

## Technologies and techniques used.

- Connected to TripleTen's GitHub account to locally clone the project repository.
- Worked locally through PyCharm
- Installed the requests and pytest libraries.
- The HTTP address and paths to send requests were configured in the configuration.py file.
- The data.py file contains the bodies to generate the user.
- POST and GET methods were developed to send and obtain data for the creation of a KIt for Urban.Grocers.
- The reading and modification of the request body has been automated, in order to send variable data and test the name field of the kit creation functionality.
- Positive and negative test functions were created using pytest.
- A total of 9 tests were executed
